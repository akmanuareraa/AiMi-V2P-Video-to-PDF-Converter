# AiMi-V2P-Video-to-PDF-Converter

I created this script specifically for students/professionals who are doing online courses. I suffered a lot sitting in front of the screen for hours watching the video, so I thought why not convert this video into a book of slides. Because mostly online platforms/lecture videos contain slides. So converting the video into individual slides helped me a lot.

* Written in Python3
* Uses OpenCV
* The tool only extracts unique slides in one direction (forward) even if the lecture/video is for 2-3 hours long using Pixel Difference
* You can fully customize the script
* Still need lot of improvements

# Usage

* You need - OpenCv, re, moviepy, optparse, scikit, matplotlib, numpy, reprint modules 

```python -v 'video.mp4' -s 5 -n 1```

* There is a "test" image along with this folder, this is for inital comparison so DO NOT DELETE it
* Copy the script into your videos folder or provide the full path of the video
* The ```-v``` option gets the video name
* The ```-s``` option tells the script to jump to every nth second into the video. Ex: If given as 5, then script jumps as follows 5,10,15,20,25...and so on until the end
* The ```-n``` option get the video number. The video number here is to avoid mixing of images. So in case if you are converting multiple videos to PDF which are in the "same folder" then give different Video number so that the images are easily differentiated. In case if you are only convreting only "one video" at a time then give the number as just "1"
* The output will be a PDF with the same name as the video

# To Do

* Capture unique slides in both directions
* If possible increase the performance
* More user friendly and custom options
